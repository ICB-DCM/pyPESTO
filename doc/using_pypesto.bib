  abstract     = {Although tissues are usually studied in isolation, this situation rarely occursin biology, as cells, tissues and organs coexist and interact across scales todetermine both shape and function. Here, we take a quantitative approachcombining data from recent experiments, mathematical modelling andBayesian parameter inference, to describe the self-assembly of multiple epi-thelial sheets by growth and collision. We use two simple and well-studiedcontinuum models, where cells move either randomly or following popu-lation pressure gradients. After suitable calibration, both models prove tobe practically identifiable, and can reproduce the main features of singletissue expansions. However, our findings reveal that whenever tissue–tissue interactions become relevant, the random motion assumption canlead to unrealistic behaviour. Under this setting, a model accounting forpopulation pressure from different cell populations is more appropriateand shows a better agreement with experimental measurements. Finally,we discuss how tissue shape and pressure affect multi-tissue collisions.Our work thus provides a systematic approach to quantify and predictcomplex tissue configurations with applications in the design of tissuecomposites and more generally in tissue engineering.},

  abstract     = {Dynamical models in the form of systems of ordinary differential equations have become a standard tool in systems biology. Many parameters of such models are usually unknown and have to be inferred from experimental data. Gradient-based optimization has proven to be effective for parameter estimation. However, computing gradients becomes increasingly costly for larger models, which are required for capturing the complex interactions of multiple biochemical pathways. Adjoint sensitivity analysis has been pivotal for working with such large models, but methods tailored for steady-state data are currently not available. We propose a new adjoint method for computing gradients, which is applicable if the experimental data include steady-state measurements. The method is based on a reformulation of the backward integration problem to a system of linear algebraic equations. The evaluation of the proposed method using real-world problems shows a speedup of total simulation time by a factor of up to 4.4. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve a substantial improvement in computation time, in particular for large-scale models, where computational efficiency is critical.},

There exist various tools for tasks like model development, model simulation, optimization, or uncertainty analysis, each with different capabilities and strengths. In order to be able to easily combine tools in an interoperable manner, but also to make results accessible and reusable for other researchers, it is valuable to define parameter estimation problems in a standardized form. Here, we introduce PEtab, a parameter estimation problem definition format which integrates with established systems biology standards for model and data specification. As the novel format is already supported by eight software tools with hundreds of users in total, we expect it to be of great use and impact in the community, both for modeling and algorithm development.},

However, owing to the tightly constrained and interconnected nature of lipid biosynthesis, both understanding and engineering of lipid metabolism remain challenging, even with the help of mathematical models. Here we report the development of a kinetic metabolic model of lipid metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that integrates fatty acid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, storage lipids, lumped sterol synthesis, and the synthesis and transport of relevant target-chemicals, such as fatty acids and fatty alcohols. The model was trained on lipidomic data of a reference S. cerevisiae strain, single knockout mutants, and lipid overproduction strains reported in literature. The model was used to design mutants for fatty alcohol overproduction and the lipidomic analysis of the resultant mutant strains coupled with model-guided hypothesis led to discovery of a futile cycle in the triacylglycerol biosynthesis pathway. In addition, the model was used to explain successful and unsuccessful mutant designs in metabolic engineering literature. Thus, this kinetic model of lipid metabolism can not only enable the discovery of new phenomenon in lipid metabolism but also the engineering of mutant strains for overproduction of lipids.},

  abstract     = {Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are widely used to study biochemical reactions in cellular networks since they effectively describe the temporal evolution of these networks using mass action kinetics. The parameters of these models are rarely known a priori and must instead be estimated by calibration using experimental data. Optimization-based calibration of ODE models on is often challenging, even for low-dimensional problems. Multiple hypotheses have been advanced to explain why biochemical model calibration is challenging, including non-identifiability of model parameters, but there are few comprehensive studies that test these hypotheses, likely because tools for performing such studies are also lacking. Nonetheless, reliable model calibration is essential for uncertainty analysis, model comparison, and biological interpretation. We implemented an established trust-region method as a modular Python framework (fides) to enable systematic comparison of different approaches to ODE model calibration involving a variety of Hessian approximation schemes. We evaluated fides on a recently developed corpus of biologically realistic benchmark problems for which real experimental data are available. Unexpectedly, we observed high variability in optimizer performance among different implementations of the same mathematical instructions (algorithms). Analysis of possible sources of poor optimizer performance identified limitations in the widely used Gauss-Newton, BFGS and SR1 Hessian approximation schemes. We addressed these drawbacks with a novel hybrid Hessian approximation scheme that enhances optimizer performance and outperforms existing hybrid approaches. When applied to the corpus of test models, we found that fides was on average more reliable and efficient than existing methods using a variety of criteria. We expect fides to be broadly useful for ODE constrained optimization problems in biochemical models and to be a foundation for future methods development.},

  year             = {2022},
  abstract         = {BRAFV600E is prototypical of oncogenic mutations that can be targeted therapeutically and treatment of BRAF-mutant melanomas with RAF and MEK inhibitors results in rapid tumor regression. However, drug-induced rewiring causes BRAFV600E melanoma cells to rapidly acquire a drug-adapted state. In patients this is thought to promote acquisition or selection for resistance mutations and disease recurrence. In this paper we use an energy-based implementation of ordinary differential equations in combination with proteomic, transcriptomic and imaging data from melanoma cells, to model the precise mechanisms responsible for adaptive rewiring. We demonstrate the presence of two parallel MAPK (RAF-MEK-ERK kinase) reaction channels in BRAFV600E melanoma cells that are differentially sensitive to RAF and MEK inhibitors. This arises from differences in protein oligomerization and allosteric regulation induced by oncogenic mutations and drug binding. As a result, the RAS-regulated MAPK channel can be active under conditions in which the BRAFV600E-driven channel is fully inhibited. Causal tracing demonstrates that this provides a sufficient quantitative explanation for initial and acquired responses to multiple different RAF and MEK inhibitors individually and in combination.HighlightsA thermodynamic framework enables structure-based description of allosteric interactions in the EGFR and MAPK pathwaysCausal decomposition of efficacy of targeted drugs elucidates rewiring of MAPK channelsModel-based extrapolation from type I{\textonehalf} RAF inhibitors to type II RAF inhibitorsA unified mechanistic explanation for adaptive and genetic resistance across BRAF-cancersCompeting Interest StatementPKS is a member of the SAB or Board of Directors of Glencoe Software, Applied Biomath, and RareCyte Inc. and has equity in these companies; PKS is also a member of the SAB of NanoString and a consultant for Montai Health and Merck.

In BRAFV600E melanomas, RAF and MEK inhibitors efficiently block oncogenic signaling, but persister cells emerge. Here, we show that persister cells escape drug-induced cell-cycle arrest via brief, sporadic ERK pulses generated by transmembrane receptors and growth factors operating in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Quantitative proteomics and computational modeling show that ERK pulsing is enabled by rewiring of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling: from an oncogenic BRAFV600E monomer-driven configuration that is drug sensitive to a receptor-driven configuration that involves Ras-GTP and RAF dimers and is highly resistant to RAF and MEK inhibitors. Altogether, this work shows that pulsatile MAPK activation by factors in the microenvironment generates a persistent population of melanoma cells that rewires MAPK signaling to sustain non-genetic drug resistance.},

In this framework, we derive a semi-analytical algorithm for gradient calculation of the optimal scaling method developed for qualitative data. This enables the use of efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that the use of gradient information improves performance of optimization and uncertainty quantification on several application examples. On average, we achieve a speedup of more than one order of magnitude compared to gradient-free optimization. In addition, in some examples, the gradient-based approach yields substantially improved objective function values and quality of the fits. Accordingly, the proposed framework substantially improves the parameterization of models from qualitative data.The proposed approach is implemented in the open-source Python Parameter EStimation TOolbox (pyPESTO). pyPESTO is available at https://github.com/ICB-DCM/pyPESTO.

Randomness impacts how developers write tests that check for end-to-end quality of their implementations of these ML algorithms.

We present FLEX, the first tool for automatically fixing flaky tests due to algorithmic randomness in ML algorithms. FLEX fixes tests that use approximate assertions to compare actual and expected values that represent the quality of the outputs of ML algorithms. We present a technique for systematically identifying the acceptable bound between the actual and expected output quality that also minimizes flakiness. Our technique is based on the Peak Over Threshold method from statistical Extreme Value Theory, which estimates the tail distribution of the output values observed from several runs. Based on the tail distribution, FLEX updates the bound used in the test, or selects the number of test re-runs, based on a desired confidence level. We evaluate FLEX on a corpus of 35 tests collected from the latest versions of 21 ML projects. Overall, FLEX identifies and proposes a fix for 28 tests.

  abstract     = {Mathematical models have been widely used during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for data interpretation, forecasting, and policy making. However, most models are based on officially reported case numbers, which depend on test availability and test strategies. The time dependence of these factors renders interpretation difficult and might even result in estimation biases.Here, we present a computational modelling framework that allows for the integration of reported case numbers with seroprevalence estimates obtained from representative population cohorts. To account for the time dependence of infection and testing rates, we embed flexible splines in an epidemiological model. The parameters of these splines are estimated, along with the other parameters, from the available data using a Bayesian approach.The application of this approach to the official case numbers reported for Munich (Germany) and the seroprevalence reported by the prospective COVID-19 Cohort Munich (KoCo19) provides first estimates for the time dependence of the under-reporting factor. Furthermore, we estimate how the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and of the testing strategy evolves over time. Overall, our results show that the integration of temporally highly resolved and representative data is beneficial for accurate epidemiological analyses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts, the University Hospital of Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, the Helmholtz Centre Munich, the University of Bonn (via the Transdiciplinary Research Areas), the University of Bielefeld, Munich Center of Health (McHealth) and the German Ministry for Education and Research (MoKoCo19, reference number 01KI20271), German Research Foundation (SEPAN, reference number HA7376/3-1), Volkswagen Stiftung (reference number: 99 450).

It was described recently that periportal fibrosis did affect the expression of CYP proteins, a set of pericentrally located drug-metabolizing enzymes. Here, we investigated whether periportal steatosis might have a similar effect. Periportal steatosis was induced in C57BL6/J mice by feeding a high-fat diet with low methionine/choline content for either two or four weeks. Steatosis severity was quantified using image analysis. Triglycerides and CYP activity were quantified in photometric or fluorometric assay. The distribution of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 was visualized by immunohistochemistry. Pharmacokinetic parameters of test drugs were determined after injecting a drug cocktail (caffeine, codeine, and midazolam). The dietary model resulted in moderate to severe mixed steatosis confined to periportal and midzonal areas. Periportal steatosis did not affect the zonal distribution of CYP expression but the activity of selected CYPs was associated with steatosis severity. Caffeine elimination was accelerated by microvesicular steatosis, whereas midazolam elimination was delayed in macrovesicular steatosis. In summary, periportal steatosis affected parameters of pericentrally located drug metabolism. This observation calls for further investigations of the highly complex interrelationship between steatosis and drug metabolism and underlying signaling mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical modelling and dynamic simulations are commonly used in systems medicine to investigate the interactions between various biological entities in time. The level of model complexity is mainly restricted by the number of model parameters that can be estimated from available experimental data and prior knowledge. The calibration of dynamic models usually requires longitudinal data from multiple individuals, which is challenging to obtain and, consequently, not always available. On the contrary, the collection of cross-sectional data is often more feasible. Here, we demonstrate how the parameters of individual dynamic models can be estimated from such cross-sectional data using a Bayesian updating method. We illustrate this approach on a model for puberty in girls with cross-sectional hormone measurement data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract         = {{Acetylation of lysine 16 of histone H4 (H4K16ac) stands out among the histone modifications, because it decompacts the chromatin fiber. The metazoan acetyltransferase MOF (KAT8) regulates transcription through H4K16 acetylation. Antibody-based studies had yielded inconclusive results about the selectivity of MOF to acetylate the H4 N-terminus. We used targeted mass spectrometry to examine the activity of MOF in the male-specific lethal core (4-MSL) complex on nucleosome array substrates. This complex is part of the Dosage Compensation Complex (DCC) that activates X-chromosomal genes in male Drosophila. During short reaction times, MOF acetylated H4K16 efficiently and with excellent selectivity. Upon longer incubation, the enzyme progressively acetylated lysines 12, 8 and 5, leading to a mixture of oligo-acetylated H4. Mathematical modeling suggests that MOF recognizes and acetylates H4K16 with high selectivity, but remains substrate-bound and continues to acetylate more N-terminal H4 lysines in a processive manner. The 4-MSL complex lacks non-coding roX RNA, a critical component of the DCC. Remarkably, addition of RNA to the reaction non-specifically suppressed H4 oligo-acetylation in favor of specific H4K16 acetylation. Because RNA destabilizes the MSL-nucleosome interaction in vitro we speculate that RNA accelerates enzyme-substrate turn-over in vivo, thus limiting the processivity of MOF, thereby increasing specific H4K16 acetylation.}},

  abstract         = {Quantitative dynamical models facilitate the understanding of biological processes and the prediction of their dynamics. The parameters of these models are commonly estimated from experimental data. Yet, experimental data generated from different techniques do not provide direct information about the state of the system but a non-linear (monotonic) transformation of it. For such semi-quantitative data, when this transformation is unknown, it is not apparent how the model simulations and the experimental data can be compared. Here, we propose a versatile spline-based approach for the integration of a broad spectrum of semi-quantitative data into parameter estimation. We derive analytical formulas for the gradients of the hierarchical objective function and show that this substantially increases the estimation efficiency. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the method allows for the reliable discovery of unknown measurement transformations. Furthermore, we show that this approach can significantly improve the parameter inference based on semi-quantitative data in comparison to available methods. Modelers can easily apply our method by using our implementation in the open-source Python Parameter EStimation TOolbox (pyPESTO).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract         = {Non-linear mixed-effects models are a powerful tool for studying heterogeneous populations in various fields, including biology, medicine, economics, and engineering. However, fitting these models to data is computationally challenging if the description of individuals is complex and the population is large. To address this issue, we propose a novel machine learning-based approach: We exploit neural density estimation based on normalizing flows to approximate individual-specific posterior distributions in an amortized fashion, thereby allowing for an efficient inference of population parameters. Applying this approach to problems from cell biology and pharmacology, we demonstrate its scalability to large data sets in an unprecedented manner. Moreover, we show that it enables accurate uncertainty quantification and extends to stochastic models, which established methods, such as SAEM and FOCEI are unable to handle. Thus, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and improves the analysis capabilities for heterogeneous populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
