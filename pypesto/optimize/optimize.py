    Do multistart optimization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    problem:
        The problem to be solved.
    optimizer:
        The optimizer to be used n_starts times.
    n_starts:
        Number of starts of the optimizer.
    ids:
        Ids assigned to the startpoints.
    startpoint_method:
        Method for how to choose start points. False means the optimizer does
        not require start points, e.g. for the 'PyswarmOptimizer'.
    result:
        A result object to append the optimization results to. For example,
        one might append more runs to a previous optimization. If None,
        a new object is created.
    engine:
        Parallelization engine. Defaults to sequential execution on a
        SingleCoreEngine.
    progress_bar:
        Whether to display a progress bar.
    options:
        Various options applied to the multistart optimization.
    history_options:
        Optimizer history options.
    filename:
        Name of the hdf5 file, where the result will be saved. Default is
        "Auto", in which case it will automatically generate a file named
        `year_month_day_optimization_result.hdf5`. Deactivate saving by
        setting filename to `None`.

    Returns
    -------
    result:
        Result object containing the results of all multistarts in
        `result.optimize_result`.
